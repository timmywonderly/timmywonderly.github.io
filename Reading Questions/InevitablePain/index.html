<p>
    The Inevitable Pain article talks about how software always has a need to change making it frustrating to work on to the point where programmers will postpone making certain, necessary, fixes to the software. Because software is so widely used, it is constantly needing to be developed. The requirements that software needs to be able to handle keeps expanding as more and more users, along with more and more problems enter the software.
<p>
    This can cause the entire architecture of the software to be redone, causing a lot of code needing to be re-done. This overwhelms developers and causes them to delay improvements that the general public wants to see. This article is stating that this fact needs to be taken seriously when deciding to develop software, being the reason most fail is because developers get overwhelmed when they are asked to make mass changes.
