<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>
    <h3>Briefly describe the four gates explained in chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.</h3>
    <p>OR Gate= output is 1 if any inputs are 1, if else 0.</p>
    <p>AND Gate= output is 1 if all inputs are 1, if else 0.</p>
   <p>NOR Gate= output is 1 if no inputs are 1, if else 0.</p>
    <p>NAND Gate= output is 1 unless all inputs are 1.</p>
</p>
<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<p>
    <h3>A half adder is built from how man "sub componets" and how many inputs and outputs?</h3>
   <p>Two components. An XOR gate (OR, NAND, AND) and an AND gate.</p>
   <p>Two outputs and two inputs make up a half adder.</p>

   <h3>How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding circuit?</h3>
    <p>53 total inputs and outputs.</p>

    <h3>How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the 8-bit adder?</h3>
    <p>144 total transistors.</p>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
    <h3>Define byte.</h3>
    <p>A byte is the smallest unit of information usually address in computers, 8 bits make up a byte.</p>
    
    <h3>What is the range of an unsigned byte? A signed two's comlement byte?</h3>
    <p>Unsigned: range of 0-255. Signed: range of -128 to 127</p>

    <h3>What does the X in the following binary number represent 1010X10101?</h3>
    <p>It represents the 32.</p>

    <h3>What is the base 16 number system called?</h3>
    <p>Hexadecimal.</p>

    <h3>Why is base 16 a good choice for representing binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>Being 16 is a power of two, the range of a byte can be shown in just 2 hexadecimal digits.</p>

    <h3>What base 16 number is 101011000011? What is an easy way to determine this without using a calculator?</h3>
    <p>Groupings of 4 bits directly relate to a hexadecimal digit. These 4 bit grouping are broken down into 10, 12, and 3 which is ac3 in hexadecimal.</p>

    <h3>What does the X represent in the following base 16 number D4AXFO?</h3>
    <p>X represents 256.</p>
</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<p>
    <h3>What do the prefix names kilo, mega, giga, tera, and peta represent in bytes and what were the Greek origins of the words?</h3>
    <p>Kilo: 1000(bytes)^1. Mega: 1000^2, Giga: 1000^3, Tera: 1000^4, Peta: 1000^5</p>
    <p>The greek meaning of kilo is thousand, mega means great, giga means giant, tera means monster, while peta means five.</p>

    <h3>At the end of Chapter 16 the author reminds the reader about something that is "very important", what is this?</h3>
    <p>RAM requires constant electricicty, all the information contained on the RAM can be lost if power is lost.</p>
