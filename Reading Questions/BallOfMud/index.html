<p>
        The "Big Ball of Mud" article talks about the logistics behind the financial and practical sides of developing and releasing software. It would be incredible if all software used was coded in the simplest way possible while working 100% correctly, but that is not possible. In order to successfully release your software, you have to get it to work, however you can. This creates the big ball of mud but at least the software works. Then customers/users are able to interface with the software, showing the developers the most important bugs to fix and where improvements can be made that will benefit the users.
