        DevOps is a new way behind developing computer software to keep up with the ever growing demand of computer users. Throughout the history of software development a few things have been realized that allow for more efficent product release and updating. Every aspect of the development process is centered around the customer and the user, starting with the design. Then all development and production information is done in the cloud allowing for improvements to be made by all diferent kinds of people from many places around the world. This allows for the initial release of the software to be relatively quick while also catching the users eye right away without an update. Then through user interface problems can be located or pointed out by users allowing for a persision fix to the bug. I think this is a great idea for the future of software developing because everything is user driven. Software can live and die in the hands of the user so why not make it conform to the user as best as possible.
