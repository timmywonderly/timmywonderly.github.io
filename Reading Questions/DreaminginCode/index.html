<h1>Dreaming in Code Questions</h1>

<h2>Chapter 0</h2>
<p>
   <h3>Who Wrote "software is hard?" Who is that guy?</h3>
    Donald Knuth is a professor at Standford and wrote "The Art of Computer Programming"

    <h3>   Programmers start counting at what number?</h3>
    0

    <h3>   What was the original sense of a hacker?
    </h3>
    Somebody who understood and accepted computers and enjoyed learning what they could do and what the user could do. In return they would create "fun" software.

    <h3>   According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled?
    </h3>
    66% or every 2 out of 3

    <h3>   Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled "No Silver Bullet"?
    </h3>
    Fred Brooks 
</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
    <h3>    What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold?
        </h3>
     Toy was the manager, Anderson was the lead coder and systems architect, Kapor founded the Open Source Applications Foundation, while Burgess and Montulli were additional programmers.

     <h3>    What is Bugzilla? 
        </h3>
     It is a program that tracks bugs that the Chandler team utillized to see how long bugs would take to fix.

     <h3>    What is OSAF?
        </h3>
     Open Source Applications Foundation.

     <h3>    What is the projects name?
        </h3>
     Chandler.

     <h3>    What will the software do?
        </h3>
     It would manage the users personal information such as emails, events, and lists.

     <h3>    What is Toy's keyword for black hole bugs?
        </h3>
     Scary.

     <h3>    What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?
        </h3>
     It was a black hole bug, nobody knew or could estimate how long the bug would take to fix.

     <h3>    What did Toy refer to as a snake?
        </h3>
     An important problem that needs to be solved but nobody has ideas to do so.

     <h3>    In the software world, what does slippage mean?
        </h3>
     Lateness or Late

     <h3>    Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?
        </h3>
     IBM 360

     <h3>    What is Brooks's Law?
        </h3>
     Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

     <h3>    Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?
        </h3>
     One-sixth of the time or about 16%.

     <h3>    Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?
        </h3>
     50% or half the time.

     <h3>    Brooks observed that the unit of effort named "man-month" only applied under what conditions?
        </h3>
     When a task is being completed by any different members with no communication between them.

     <h3>    What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?
        </h3>
     Source code is written by an actual person where .exe files contain machine code which the processor directly interprets.

     <h3>    What is the one article of faith that sll open source or free software advocates share?
        </h3>
     The open source software will become better than any competing close software because anyone can add their ideas to the free software to improve it.

     <h3>    What is the difference between a good programmer and a great programmer?
        </h3>
     Good programmers know how and what to write in code. Great programmers know how to rewrite to improve performance.

     <h3>    Eric Raymond's book "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.
        </h3>
     The "Cathedral" idea is to release the project when it is ready and finished, keeping a small team and managing their work load.
     The "Bazzar" idea is to release the project as soon as you can and keep updating it to the user using many team members to try new ideas out.

     <h3>    Has open source software project development refuted Brooks's mythical man-month concerns?
        </h3>
     The internet allows already established programmers to be able to view the software, and use it, simply. This eliminates the time of bringing in a new person to the team and bringing them up to speed.

     <h3>    What was Andy Hertzfeld's input when the Chandler project appered to have stalled?
        </h3>
     He recommended the "Bazaar" style, having drafts of the Chandler project running and accessible before working on the design details.

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>
 <h3> Linus Torvalds used a science and witchcraft analogy referring to software, explain.</h3>
    Science uses a knowledge sharing system, just like open source software. In witchcraft, knowledge is not shared as in closed source software. Torvalds is saying the closed source software will not be as previlent or successful as open sourced.

  <h3>People often refer to starting their computer as booting their computer. What was the origin of this term?</h3>  
    Booting comes from the term bootstrapping. When the computer starts up it is pulling itself up by the bootstraps by starting specific software. The computer learns and improves its self over time knowing which software to start up during boot.

  <h3>Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?</h3>  
    Palo Alto Research Center.

  <h3>List three software project train wrecks.</h3>  
    Future Combat System, the 2004 UK pension crash, and Trilogy.

</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>
    <h3>When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise plan to throw one away?</h3>
    The chances are you are not going to get everything right on your first try or you will find ways to improve it after you publish your original.

    <h3>What is a core dump? Why the use of the word core?</h3>
    When a fatal error happens to a computer the computers contents are copied to what is called a "core dump". Computer's memory used to be build from ferrite cores, hense the term core.

    <h3>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110 1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?
    </h3>
    That language is called Assembly.

    <h3>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobal, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program coverted Fortran to binary?</h3>
    A compiler was the kind of program used.

</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>
    <h3>What do front ends and back ends mean to software developers?</h3>
    The user interacts with the front end of the program, the back end of a program is everything else, the part the computer does without user interaction.

    <h3>What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?</h3>
    Reusing parts in software development so that code does not need to be written.

    <h3>Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.</h3>
    It does not give the flexibility that a great professional coder can offer. Useful programs are usually very complicated and very different from one another. Great programmers are trying to design programs as simply as possible while trying to do great things as well. If they were just to reuse parts from previous software, the new software may not be as optimal as it could.

</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>
<h3>What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome.</h3>
Fast, cheap, or good. Software projects need to focus on two of those choices.

<h3>What is the more recent definition of "geek"</h3>
A person immersed in a certain subject and persues a skill.

<h3>What does refactoring mean to programmers?</h3>
Rewriting code to improve it, speed or performance, without changing the function of the program.

<h3>What is yak-shaving</h3>
An activity which helps solve a programming problem indirectly.

</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>
    <h3>What is term edge cases referring to in software development?</h3>
    It refers to unlikely scenarios, most of the time bugs are hidden in these edge cases. The bugs are hidden because the programmer did not expect them to be there.

    <h3>Summarize briefly Linus Torvalds adivce about large projects give in 2004.</h3>
    Do one thing and do it well. Don't take on large multi problem projects. Projects should solve one immediate need and that alone, then create another project to solve something else.

</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>
    <h3>Briefly describe Hungarian notation.</h3>
    It is a way of naming variables where the type of the variable is already set.

    <h3>What does the author state is the single most challenging demand of softwar development?</h3>
    Communicating abstractions unambiguously.


</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>
    <h3>What does eat your own dogfood mean?</h3>
    A product is known as the food and the consumer is known as the dog. Eating your own dogfood means the company is using its own products.

    <h3>Quote: "When people ask for numbers that far out, the traditional thing that engineers do..." When discussing the timeline for Chandler, how was the quote above completed?</h3>
    The traditional thing that engineers do is make the number up.
