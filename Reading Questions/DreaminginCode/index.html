   <h3>Who Wrote "software is hard?" Who is that guy?</h3>
    Donald Knuth is a professor at Standford and wrote "The Art of Computer Programming"

    <h3>   Programmers start counting at what number?</h3>
    0

    <h3>   What was the original sense of a hacker?
    </h3>
    Somebody who understood and accepted computers and enjoyed learning what they could do and what the user could do. In return they would create "fun" software.

    <h3>   According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled?
    </h3>
    66% or every 2 out of 3

    <h3>   Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled "No Silver Bullet"?
    </h3>
    Fred Brooks

    What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold?
     Toy was the manager, Anderson was the lead coder and systems architect, Kapor founded the Open Source Applications Foundation, while Burgess and Montulli were additional programmers.

    What is Bugzilla? 
     It is a program that tracks bugs that the Chandler team utillized to see how long bugs would take to fix.

    What is OSAF?
     Open Source Applications Foundation.
     
    What is the projects name?
     Chandler.
    
    What will the software do?
     It would manage the users personal information such as emails, events, and lists.
     
    What is Toy's keyword for black hole bugs?
     Scary.
    
    What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?
     It was a black hole bug, nobody knew or could estimate how long the bug would take to fix.

    What did Toy refer to as a snake?
     An important problem that needs to be solved but nobody has ideas to do so.

    In the software world, what does slippage mean?
     Lateness or Late
     
    Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?
     IBM 360
     
    What is Brooks's Law?
     Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
    
    Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?
     One-sixth of the time or about 16%.
     
    Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?
     50% or half the time.
     
    Brooks observed that the unit of effort named "man-month" only applied under what conditions?
     When a task is being completed by any different members with no communication between them.
     
    What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?
     Source code is written by an actual person where .exe files contain machine code which the processor directly interprets.

    What is the one article of faith that sll open source or free software advocates share?
     The open source software will become better than any competing close software because anyone can add their ideas to the free software to improve it.

    What is the difference between a good programmer and a great programmer?
     Good programmers know how and what to write in code. Great programmers know how to rewrite to improve performance.
     
    Eric Raymond's book "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.
     The "Cathedral" idea is to release the project when it is ready and finished, keeping a small team and managing their work load.
     The "Bazzar" idea is to release the project as soon as you can and keep updating it to the user using many team members to try new ideas out.
     
    Has open source software project development refuted Brooks's mythical man-month concerns?
     The internet allows already established programmers to be able to view the software, and use it, simply. This eliminates the time of bringing in a new person to the team and bringing them up to speed.
     
    What was Andy Hertzfeld's input when the Chandler project appered to have stalled?
     He recommended the "Bazaar" style, having drafts of the Chandler project running and accessible before working on the design details.
